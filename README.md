# CodingQuestionsQuiz

## Description

The motivation for this project was to create a quiz game that helps the user practice their JavaScript knowledge. By using Web APIs, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I was able to create a simple multi-screen game that the user can interact with. I learned how to create dynamic HTML elements with JavaScript in multiple screens while also using the users local storage in one instance of a game to keep a simple high score history. I also learned how to manipulate and handle user inputs to determine which screen should show next, how the timer and score is affected, and writing over initial HTML text to display different text dynamically as well. The thing I am most proud of with this project is that I was able to use my own design of screen switching to make elements appear and disappear without code reuse. With the completion of this project I fulfilled the following user acceptance criteria.

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

This project taught me how to use dynamic HTML building using Web APIs with JavaScript. In the future, I would try to incorporate a randomized selection of the questions. In addition, I would love to add better styling to the quiz to give feedback to the user for which questions they got right or which ones they missed. This would make the UX more appealing and intelligent than just a quiz and a score.

## Installation
