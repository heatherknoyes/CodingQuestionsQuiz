# CodingQuestionsQuiz

## Description

-- edit here --
The motivation for this project was to create the JavaScript logic behind a password generator. By using simple techniques of arrays, pre-defined functions, logical statements, and creating my own functions I learned how to manipulate data to check if requirements have been fulfilled. I also learned how to manipulate and handle user input and response to determine what data is outputted to the user. The thing I am most proud of with this project is that I was able to implement logic to check if the user criteria had been met with the password. I did this by testing a password with four characters and making sure that the password was regenerated if there were four criteria until all four criteria had been met for the password. With the completion of this project I fulfilled the following user acceptance criteria.

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

This project taught me introductory techniques on I can take input from a user and use it to output messaging to the user. In the future, I would try to incorporate the user messaging into a more UI friendly manner such that the prompt does not show OK/Cancel but either has a listener on a toggle in the UI or has a checkbox that I could read. This would make the UX more appealing and intelligent than the prompt way that it is today.

## Installation

1. Download all files within the main directory as well as the assets directory to your device.

2. Open the index.html file in your browser to view the website.

3. If future edits need to be made then the stylesheet can be found under ./assets/css/style.css. The javascript can be found under the ./assets/js/script.js.

## Usage

The following image shows the web application's appearance in a screenshot:
